This error occurs when using the `useEffect` hook in React Native with a cleanup function that throws an error. This is often caused by trying to access or modify a component's state or props after the component has unmounted.  The cleanup function might still be running when the component is unmounted, leading to a state update on an unmounted component error. Here is an example of such code:

```javascript
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  useEffect(() => {
    const interval = setInterval(() => {
      setCount(prevCount => prevCount + 1);
    }, 1000);

    return () => {
      clearInterval(interval);
      // This line might throw an error if the component unmounts before clearInterval completes
      console.log('count:', count); //Error prone line
    };
  }, []);

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>{count}</Text>
    </View>
  );
};
```
