The solution involves checking if the component is still mounted before attempting to access or modify state within the cleanup function.  React provides a way to manage component mounting status with the use of a `mounted` ref. Here's the corrected code:

```javascript
import React, { useState, useEffect, useRef } from 'react';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  const mounted = useRef(true);

  useEffect(() => {
    const interval = setInterval(() => {
      setCount(prevCount => prevCount + 1);
    }, 1000);

    return () => {
      mounted.current = false; // Set mounted to false before cleanup
      clearInterval(interval);
    };
  }, []);

  return (
    <View>
      {mounted.current && <Text>{count}</Text>}
    </View>
  );
};
```

By setting `mounted.current` to `false` before the cleanup function executes, we prevent any actions that may occur after the component is unmounted. The conditional rendering using `mounted.current` ensures the component does not try to access or modify the state after unmounting.
